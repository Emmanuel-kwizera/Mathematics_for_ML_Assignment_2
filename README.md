# Mathematics_for_ML_Assignment_2

This project contains code and visualizations for an assignment in Mathematics for Machine Learning. The main notebook, `Emmanuel_Kwizera_and_Jacques_Twizeyimana_assignment_2.ipynb`, performs data analysis and generates plots related to greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle statistics.

## Contents

- `Emmanuel_Kwizera_and_Jacques_Twizeyimana_assignment_2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for data analysis and plotting.
- `outputs/`: Directory containing generated plots:
  - `co2_Histogram.png`: Histogram of CO2 emissions.
  - `ghgScore_histogram.png`: Histogram of greenhouse gas scores.
  - `Heatmap.png`: Heatmap visualization.
  - `highway_Histogram.png`: Histogram of highway statistics.

## Usage

Open and run `Emmanuel_Kwizera_and_Jacques_Twizeyimana_assignment_2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the analysis and plots. Generated figures will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
